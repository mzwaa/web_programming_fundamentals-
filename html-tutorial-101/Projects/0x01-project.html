    <h2>Camping Under the Stars</h2> <!-- Memory title as second-level heading -->

    <p>One of my favorite memories is a weekend camping trip I took with my family when I was ten years old. We traveled to a quiet forest by a lake, far from the noise of the city. As soon as we arrived, we pitched our tent, gathered firewood, and explored the peaceful surroundings.  
    <br>It was my first time really experiencing nature up close.</p>

    <p>That evening, we cooked dinner over an open fire and shared stories while roasting marshmallows. As night fell, we laid out sleeping bags under the open sky instead of sleeping in the tent. I remember looking up and seeing more stars than I had ever seen before—so many that it felt like the sky was glowing.</p>

    <p>What made the night even more magical was the sound of the forest—crickets chirping, leaves rustling, and a distant owl hooting. It was peaceful, exciting, and a little mysterious all at once. That trip sparked my love for the outdoors and remains one of the happiest and most vivid memories I have.</p>
