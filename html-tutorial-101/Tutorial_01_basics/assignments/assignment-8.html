    <h1>Classic Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This rich and hearty spaghetti Bolognese is a traditional Italian favorite made with ground beef, tomatoes, and aromatic herbs. It's a perfect dish for family dinners and can be prepared in under an hour.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, and basil. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Serve the sauce over the cooked spaghetti and top with grated Parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>For an even deeper flavor, simmer the sauce for longer—up to an hour if you have time. You can also add a splash of red wine when cooking the beef for a richer taste.</p>
